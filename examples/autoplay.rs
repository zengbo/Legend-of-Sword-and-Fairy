//! Auto-play the game and record it to a video.
//!
//! Boots the engine exactly like `main()` does (trademark reel, splash screen,
//! opening menu, then `PAL_GameMain`) with two things attached:
//!
//!   * a **synthetic keyboard** (`Engine::autopilot`) that presses confirm and
//!     the arrow keys at a human cadence.  It goes through the same
//!     `InputState` a real keyboard does, so every dialog, menu, script and
//!     battle runs the normal way — nothing is faked or fast-pathed.
//!   * an **offline audio mixer** plus the per-present `frame_sink`, so the
//!     recording carries the real OPL music and sound effects, sample-aligned
//!     with the captured frames.
//!
//! Recording happens in two phases, because the engine clock is wall-clock
//! (`Engine::ticks` is `Instant::elapsed`) and the neural upscaler costs tens
//! of milliseconds per frame.  Upscaling *while* the game runs would push the
//! game behind real time while the music — rendered against the same clock —
//! kept its pace, so the picture would drift into slow motion against the
//! sound.  Instead:
//!
//!   * **record** plays the game in real time and dumps cheap 320x200 frames,
//!     their engine ticks, and the PCM audio;
//!   * **encode** comes back afterwards with no deadline, runs every distinct
//!     frame through the upscaler, sample-and-holds to a constant frame rate,
//!     and muxes 1280x800 H.264 with the audio.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   autoplay record <dir> [seconds]   record only (headless)
//!   autoplay encode <dir> [fps]       encode a previous recording
//!   autoplay <dir> [seconds] [fps]    both
//!
//! Watch in the terminal while recording (or recording+encode):
//!   autoplay record --console <dir> [seconds]
//!   autoplay record --console=kitty <dir> [seconds]
//!   autoplay --console <dir> [seconds] [fps]
//!
//! Optional HTTP control while console is up (same as the main binary):
//!   RUSTPAL_UI_DRIVER=127.0.0.1:8765 autoplay record --console <dir> [seconds]
